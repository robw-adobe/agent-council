"""MockCLIAdapter — deterministic canned outputs for offline testing.

This adapter never shells out to anything. It returns role-specific JSON-shaped
outputs keyed off the deliberator name found in the prompt header (e.g.
"Skeptic — Agent Council Deliberator"). It is the test substrate for the W1
end-to-end fixture — it lets the orchestrator and verdict policy run without
burning real Claude tokens.

The canned outputs intentionally include 1-2 ``would_block:true`` deliberators
plus a REVISE verdict from the Adjudicator, so the end-to-end test exercises
the full verdict-policy code path (not just SHIP).

W2 extension (2026-05-12, RW2-1 mitigation): Added bench-mode canned payloads
for ``bench_baseline``, ``unified_judge``, and ``uqr_judge`` roles. The new
routes are detected via explicit header markers ("# uqr_judge", "Unified
Judge", "Bench task") that the bench-mode adapters inject, so existing P0
Council routes (skeptic / voice_identity / evidence / strategy / adjudicator)
remain unchanged. P0 tests continue to pass.
