> *Five reviewers pull your draft apart, keep their disagreement visible, and hand you one verdict — for the text you can't un-ship.*

A runtime-portable 5-agent council that adjudicates text artifacts before they ship. Five role-conditioned LLM deliberators run in a 2-round async protocol with cross-read rebuttal. One verdict — `SHIP`, `REVISE`, or `HOLD` — plus a structured revision brief and a full audit transcript.

No SDK. No API keys. No vendor lock-in. The Council shells out to whatever LLM CLI is configured (`claude`, `copilot`, `lmstudio`, `ollama`, mock). Modularity invariant is CI-tested — the council can be removed and producing agents keep working unchanged.

*Personal research, separate from my day-job at Microsoft. MIT-licensed.*

## Install

### Claude Code (plugin)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Avyayalaya/agent-council
claude plugin install agent-council@avyayalaya
```

Then in any Claude Code session: `/council-review path/to/artifact.md` or `/council-sweep`.

### Python (pip from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avyayalaya/agent-council.git
cd agent-council
pip install -e .
cp council.yaml.example council.yaml  # then edit
python -m agent_council review path/to/artifact.md --tier=1
```

**GitHub Copilot users:** for a one-file setup, copy the ready-to-go Copilot config instead — `cp council.copilot.yaml.example council.yaml`. It has the `copilot_cli` runtime and the validated flags already active, so you only need the `copilot` CLI installed + authenticated.

**Reviewing code instead of prose?** Copy the software-council preset — `cp council.software.yaml.example council.yaml`. It runs on the `copilot_cli` runtime and repurposes two deliberators for engineering review: `voice_identity` → **Code Quality & Conventions** (`prompts/code_quality.md`) and `strategy` → **Architecture & Scope** (`prompts/architecture.md`), backed by editable Python/Flask/pytest corpora in `examples/code_standards.example.md` and `examples/engineering_goals.example.md`. Slot ids are kept for schema compatibility, so no source/test changes are needed.

Requires Python ≥3.11 and at least one supported LLM CLI on PATH.

### MCP server (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, custom agents)

```bash
pip install mcp>=1.0
```

Add to your client's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-council": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["<absolute-path>/agent-council/mcp/agent_council_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "COUNCIL_CONFIG": "<absolute-path>/agent-council/council.yaml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Tool exposed: `council_review(artifact_path, tier=1)`. Full setup: [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md). `council_sweep` and `council_audit` tools land in v0.1.2.

### the analytics product CLI, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode (via APM Skills)

`v0.1.1` ships each deliberator as a standalone Skill under [`skills/`](skills/) so any APM-compatible harness gets the methodology inline — no Python CLI required for single-perspective review.

```bash
apm marketplace add Avyayalaya/agent-council
apm install agent-council --target copilot
```

Then in the harness, load one Skill at a time:

- [`skeptic-review`](skills/skeptic-review/) — adversarial steelman pass
- [`voice-identity-review`](skills/voice-identity-review/) — line-level voice audit + CXO test
- [`evidence-calibration-review`](skills/evidence-calibration-review/) — per-claim T1-T6 evidence-tier audit
- [`strategy-stakes-review`](skills/strategy-stakes-review/) — goal-fit and opportunity-cost check
- [`adjudicator-synthesis`](skills/adjudicator-synthesis/) — verdict synthesis from 2+ deliberator outputs

Use cases per surface:

| Use case | Surface |
|---|---|
| Run full automated Council on an artifact with parallel deliberators + 2-round cross-read + JSONL audit | `python -m agent_council review path/to/artifact.md --tier=1` or MCP `council_review` tool |
| Apply one deliberator role to a doc I am editing right now (the analytics product, Claude, Cursor) | Load the matching Skill |
| Compose 2 or 3 deliberators ad-hoc for a multi-angle ad-hoc review | Load multiple Skills sequentially, then optionally load `adjudicator-synthesis` |
| Use slash commands in Claude Code | `/council-review path/to/artifact.md` (Claude Code only) |

### Skills vs CLI — what you get on each path

The Skills are the **interactive** single-perspective surface. The CLI / MCP is the **automated** full-Council surface. They share the same 5-deliberator methodology but trade differently:

| Capability | Compose Skills sequentially | Full Council via CLI / MCP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| One perspective at a time | yes | yes (the deliberators) |
| Parallel deliberator execution | no | yes |
| Round 2 cross-read rebuttal (each deliberator sees the other 3 R1 critiques) | no | yes |
| Adjudicator prior-verdict compounding loop on `artifact_type` | no | yes |
| JSONL audit log, replayable | no | yes |
| Single adjudicated verdict (not 5 separate critiques) | no | yes |
| Structured, persisted verdict record per run | no | yes |
| Cost per review | 1 LLM call per Skill | ~9 LLM calls (4 deliberators × 2 rounds + Adjudicator) |
| Sweet spot | Ad-hoc 1 or 2 perspectives on a doc you are editing | Pre-ship gating in pipelines; structured, persisted audit trail |

Composing 5 Skills sequentially produces 5 independent critiques. That is useful for ad-hoc multi-angle review, but it is not the same artifact as the automated Council. If you need parallel execution, cross-read rebuttal, or a structured, persisted JSONL verdict record, use the CLI / MCP path.

### Any other LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, manual)

Read the 5 prompts at [`prompts/`](prompts/). Each is self-contained and explains what the deliberator should produce. Run them in your tool of choice, then merge the verdicts using the policy in [`src/agent_council/verdict.py`](src/agent_council/verdict.py).

### The five roles

| Deliberator | Concern | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| **Skeptic** | Adversarial review — catches premature coherence, narrative fallacy, survivorship bias, unstated assumptions | (artifact only) |
| **Voice & Identity** | Voice DNA, banned-pattern enforcement, channel register, CXO test | Operator's voice corpus + persona DNA |
| **Evidence & Calibration** | Source verification, evidence-tier classification (T1–T6), confidence levels, base rates | (artifact only) |
| **Strategy & Stakes** | Goal alignment, stake calibration, opportunity cost vs. operator's active projects | Operator's goals doc + project state |
| **Adjudicator** | Merge + prior-verdict loop. Final verdict and revision brief | All four above + `council_log.jsonl` |

### Why a council, not a single judge?

LLM-as-judge approaches collapse five distinct concerns into one critic:

- Is the argument adversarially sound?
- Does it match the operator's voice?
- Are the sources credible?
- Does it advance the operator's actual goals?
- Should it ship?

A unified judge averages these into one score. The Council keeps them separated. Each deliberator owns one concern, reads one context, surfaces one kind of dissent. The Adjudicator merges them — but you see *which* deliberator blocked and *why*, not just the merged number.

This matters for tier-1 artifacts where the cost of shipping a flaw is high (public publish, irreversible commitment, identity-shaping document) and the cost of one more revision pass is low.

---

## Quickstart

After `pip install -e .` and copying `council.yaml.example` → `council.yaml`:

```bash
# Single artifact
python -m agent_council review path/to/artifact.md --tier=1

# Daily sweep over watch paths
python -m agent_council sweep --since=24h

# Audit recent verdicts (filter by date/verdict/artifact-type)
python -m agent_council audit --since=7d --verdict=HOLD
```

Output goes to stdout as JSON; the audit row appends to `council_log.jsonl`.

### See what a verdict looks like

[`examples/demo/`](examples/demo/) ships a fictional LinkedIn post + the structured verdict the Council produced for it + the extracted revision brief. Read these first to calibrate expectations before running your first real review.

### Tier classification

The Council is designed for **tier-1 artifacts** — the ones where review cost is justified:

- **Tier 1** (gates through Council): external-facing OR irreversible OR identity-shaping OR memory writes. Examples: published writing, public READMEs, investor messages, resume revisions, additions to a learnings file, memory writes.
- **Tier 2** (skips Council): internal drafts, dashboards, infrastructure, dispatch updates.
- **Tier 3** (1-in-5 sample): daily briefings, internal analyses, planning artifacts.

Tier classification is rule-based — glob patterns in `council.yaml#tier_rules`.

---

## Built for agents

The Council was designed to be invoked from outside an agent loop, not from inside it. That's not a stylistic choice — it's a **CI-tested invariant**:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest tests.test_modularity_invariant -v
```

The test scans the host operator system's `agents/*/prompt.md` files and asserts zero references to Council. If a producing agent's prompt starts to know about the gate that reviews it, the build fails.

This means:

- An orchestrator can route any artifact to Council without touching the producing agent.
- Removing the Council leaves every producing agent functional (with reduced quality on tier-1 artifacts).
- The Council ships as a **standalone runtime** — wire it into Emissary, MCP servers, slash commands, CI pipelines, or your own agent system without coupling.

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the machine-readable capability manifest — agent orchestrators read this to route tasks without reading 1,300 lines of source.

---

## Customize

### Add a new runtime adapter (one file)

```python
# src/agent_council/runtimes/my_runtime.py
from .base import RuntimeAdapter

class MyRuntimeAdapter(RuntimeAdapter):
    async def invoke(self, prompt: str, *, timeout: int) -> str:
        # Shell out / HTTP / SDK call — return the model's response.
        ...
```

Register in `src/agent_council/runtimes/__init__.py`, reference by `type:` in `council.yaml`. The adapter's interface is the only contract; the orchestrator handles retries, schema validation, cross-read marshaling.

### Add a new deliberator (one prompt file)

Drop a `prompts/<name>.md` following the 5-section template:

1. **Role declaration** — who you are, what you optimize for, what you do NOT do.
2. **Methodology** — numbered steps for reading the artifact and producing the critique.
3. **Context Verification Gate** — files this deliberator must have access to.
4. **Output schema** — matching the JSON shape in [`src/agent_council/schema.py`](src/agent_council/schema.py).
5. **Communication style** — 3–5 example phrases showing the deliberator's editorial voice.

Add a block to `council.yaml#deliberators`. The orchestrator picks it up.

### Override the verdict policy

`src/agent_council/verdict.py:VerdictPolicy.apply` is the single source of truth. Subclass it and pass to the orchestrator if you need different merge semantics. Unit tests at `tests/test_verdict_merge.py` pin the default behavior — fork them for your override.

---

## Audit log

Every Council invocation appends one line to `council_log.jsonl`. Schema follows Rule 35 v2:

```json
{
  "v": 2,
  "ts": "2026-05-18T...Z",
  "artifact": "path/to/artifact.md",
  "artifact_type": "linkedin_post",
  "round1": [{"deliberator": "skeptic", "verdict": "revise", "scores": {...}, "would_block": false, "revision_brief": "..."}, ...],
  "round2": [...],
  "adjudicator": {
    "final_verdict": "REVISE",
    "reasoning": "...",
    "revision_brief": "...",
    "applied_compounding": true,
    "prior_verdicts_consulted": 3
  }
}
```

Append-only. The Adjudicator reads prior entries on the same `artifact_type` to apply the **D6 compounding loop** — every new verdict consults the history. Two consecutive HOLDs on the same artifact_type sharpen the Adjudicator's reasoning on the third pass.

Filter with `jq` or the `audit` subcommand:

```bash
jq 'select(.adjudicator.final_verdict == "HOLD")' council_log.jsonl
python -m agent_council audit --since=7d --verdict=HOLD
```

---

## Runtimes

| Runtime | Recommended for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude_cli` | Production tier-1 gating | Requires Anthropic Claude CLI installed + authenticated. Default. |
| `copilot_cli` | Production gating via GitHub Copilot | Requires the `copilot` CLI installed + authenticated. Non-interactive (`-p`); use `-s --no-custom-instructions --allow-all-tools` in `flags`. |
| `lmstudio` | Local sub-sample testing | HTTP 500 on large parallel prompts at default concurrency — tune `max_concurrent` and `context_length`. |
| `ollama` | Offline / local-first | Lower-end models may not satisfy the deliberator schema; fall back to `claude_cli` for production. |
| `mock_cli` | CI / smoke tests | Canned responses for testing the orchestrator without burning tokens. |
| `gh_models` | Stub (documented fallback) | Placeholder for future GitHub Models adapter. |

Mix runtimes within a single Council run — e.g., one deliberator on `lmstudio` for style diversity, the rest on `claude_cli`. Configure per-deliberator `runtime_override:` in `council.yaml`.

---

## Honest limitations

- **Soft file-path coupling.** Voice & Identity and Strategy & Stakes read external context files. What they contain is the operator's responsibility.
- **Same-model self-style risk.** When all deliberators run on the same underlying model, they share that model's style preferences and may converge on its blind spots. Mitigation: run one deliberator on a different model family.
- **Behavioral coupling on producing agents.** If a producing agent learns "the Council will catch X," it may loosen on X. Structural and unfixable inside the package; mitigation is operator discipline (periodic audits with Council OFF vs. ON).
- **Adjudicator non-determinism.** Same artifact can produce slightly different verdicts across runs. Documented; treated as honest LLM-as-judge variance.

---

## Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

105 tests. The orchestrator test uses `mock_cli`, so no real Claude tokens burn during CI.
